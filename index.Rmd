<h3>"Education is not expensive, it's priceless."</h3>

Unfortunately, the reality today is that it is often both. Not only are college fees rising yearly, the cost of private tutoring has also skyrocketed. This comes at the expense of social equality and mobility, as students from less well-off backgrounds lack the ability to pay for extra tuition.

Teach and Reach is a non-profit organization focused on linking students from disadvantaged backgrounds with volunteer tutors all around New York City. In doing so, we aim to reduce educational inequalities and improve social mobility for underprivileged families in the city. 

We believe that education should be priceless, not pricey. 

Have a look in the 'Demand' tab to see where we need tutors, and consider helping us out by volunteering an hour a week to tutor a child.
